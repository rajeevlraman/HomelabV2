# HomelabV2
## Overview
Welcome to my New home lab setup! "HomelabV2" I've created this environment to learn and understand various aspects of networking,Docker and containerization,Cloud Services integration to on prem network, monitoring, prevention, administration, and hardening techniques. It's been an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited to share my setup with you.

### Hardware
- **Host PC:** Repurposed gaming PC with upgraded RAM to 64GB and a 2TB M.2 storage for enhanced performance.
- **Network Segmentation:** I've segmented the network to simulate an internal and external network, using span ports to direct all data to the monitoring system.
- **Raspberry Pis:** I've included three Raspberry Pis in my setup:
  - One hosts Nessus vulnerability scanner.
  - Another runs Home Assistant for home automation.
  - The third is dedicated to Pi-Hole, serving as my DNS server primarily for ad-blocking.

### Virtual Machines
- **Host OS:** Windows 11
- **Firewall/IDS:** PfSense with wazuh extension
- **External Attack Machine:** Kali Linux
- **Windows Domain Controller:** Windows server 2022
- **Windows Client Machine:** Windows 10 and windows 8
- **Vulnerable Machines:** Four intentionally vulnerable machines for testing and practice.
- **Monitoring:** Wazuh and Nessus.
- **Incident Response:** The Hiive and cortex.
- **Security Onion:** Monitoring all traffic via PfSense.

## Purpose
My home lab serves as a hands-on environment for:
- Learning networking concepts and technologies.
- Practicing monitoring, prevention, and administration techniques.
- Experimenting with home automation using Home Assistant.
- Experiimenting with the Incident response using TheHive project.
- Conducting vulnerability assessments with Nessus.
- Testing security measures and configurations.
