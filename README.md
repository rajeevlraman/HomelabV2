# HomelabV2
## Overview
Welcome to my home lab setup! "Dashershomelab" I've created this environment to learn and understand various aspects of networking, monitoring, prevention, administration, and hardening techniques. It's been an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited to share my setup with you.

### Hardware
- **Host PC:** Repurposed gaming PC with upgraded RAM to 64GB and a 2TB M.2 storage for enhanced performance.
- **Network Segmentation:** I've segmented the network to simulate an internal and external network, using span ports to direct all data to the monitoring system.
- **Raspberry Pis:** I've included three Raspberry Pis in my setup:
  - One hosts Nessus vulnerability scanner.
  - Another runs Home Assistant for home automation.
  - The third is dedicated to Pi-Hole, serving as my DNS server primarily for ad-blocking.

### Virtual Machines
- **Host OS:** Windows 11
- **Firewall/IDS:** PfSense with Snort extension
- **External Attack Machine:** Kali Linux
- **Windows Domain Controller:** With two client PCs
- **Vulnerable Machines:** Four intentionally vulnerable machines for testing and practice.
- **Monitoring:**
  - **Splunk:** Monitoring the Windows environment.
  - **Security Onion:** Monitoring all traffic via PfSense span port.

## Purpose
My home lab serves as a hands-on environment for:
- Learning networking concepts and technologies.
- Practicing monitoring, prevention, and administration techniques.
- Experimenting with home automation using Home Assistant.
- Conducting vulnerability assessments with Nessus.
- Testing security measures and configurations.
